Test the hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. 

Hypothesis: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. 
I've runned a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom)

The instructions for the codes contained in this repository were given by the university of michigan, through the coursera platform. 
However, I developed the codes entirely on my own. The data that I used ins avaiable here and I'm open to ask any doubts.
